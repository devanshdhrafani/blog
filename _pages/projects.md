## SLAM and Autonomous Navigation of Differential Drive robot

ROS package that implements SLAM on a 2 wheeled differential drive robot to map an unknown environment. A joystick is used to teleoperate the robot which is simulated in the Gazebo environment. The map generated is then used for autonomous navigation using the ROS Navigation stack.

## Microfluidic Electrochemical Sensor using 3D ink extrution PCB printer

5 month research project at MEMS Lab, BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus under the supervision of Dr. Satish K Dubey and Mr J Murli Mohan. Developed a novel method for fabrication of PoC Electrochemical Sensor. The project explored the use of a 3D ink extrution PCB printer to print conductive carbon ink on glass substrate to create a low cost, portable electrochemical sensor for detection of various analytes.
